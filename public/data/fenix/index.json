We may be able to record the events listed above\ninto different buckets but we kept the implementation simple for now.\n<br><br>\nN.B.: for implementation simplicity, we duplicate the logic in app that\ndetermines `path` so it's not perfectly accurate. In one way, we record we\nis intended to happen rather than what actually happened (e.g. the user\nmay click a link so we record VIEW but the app does a MAIN by going to the\nhomescreen because the link was invalid).\n", "extra_keys": null, "type": "labeled_counter", "expires": "2021-10-09"}, {"name": "performance.interaction.keypress_present_latency", "description": "Time between receiving a keypress event in the event loop and compositing its result onto the screen.\n", "extra_keys": null, "type": "timing_distribution", "expires": "never", "origin": "engine-gecko"}, {"name": "performance.interaction.mouseup_click_present_latency", "description": "Time between receiving a mouseup which follow by a mouseclick on the event loop and compositing its result onto the screen.\n", "extra_keys": null, "type": "timing_distribution", "expires": "never", "origin": "engine-gecko"}, {"name": "performance.interaction.tab_switch_composite", "description": "Time between tab selection and first composite of the tab content onto the screen.\n", "extra_keys": null, "type": "timing_distribution", "expires": "never", "origin": "engine-gecko"}, {"name": "performance.page.non_blank_paint", "description": "The time between navigationStart and the first non-blank paint of a foreground root content document, in milliseconds.
